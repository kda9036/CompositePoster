# Project Description

Create a vector-based illustration in Adobe Illustrator by manually tracing a source image composed from
multiple photographic sources used as a template.

Begin by combining elements from several images into a single composition in Photoshop. Use masking
to isolate relevant areas and use layers to create your ideal composition.

Place your composite image into Illustrator and create the layered elements of your image.

You must include a limited amount of text in your illustration.  Create duplicate text layers and convert text to outline before submitting final art.
